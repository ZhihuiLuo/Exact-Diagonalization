A Python implementation of exact diagonalization for fermion system. Simple enough but also flexiable for both pedagogical and advanced purpose.

The output matrices are all stored as scipy.sparse instances. An example can be found in ```2site.py```. Be cautious of the use of variable names ```c,cdag,N,Nd,Nu,Sz```, which have already been occupied as function names defined in ```exact_diag.py```.

Python>=3.10 is required.

Remains under maintenance.
