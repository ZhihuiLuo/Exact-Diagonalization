A Python implementation of exact diagonalization for fermion system. 
The output matrices are stored as scipy.sparse instance.

An example can be found in 2site.py. Be cautious of the use of variable names ```c,cdag,c,N,Nd,Nu,Sz```, which have been used as function names defined in the main ```exact_diag.py``` file.

Python>=3.10 is required.
