A Python implementation of exact diagonalization for fermion system. The output matrices are stored as scipy.sparse instances.

An example can be found in ```2site.py```. Be cautious of the use of variable names ```c,cdag,N,Nd,Nu,Sz```, which have already been occupied as function names defined in the main ```exact_diag.py``` file.

Python>=3.10 is required.

Remains under maintenance.
